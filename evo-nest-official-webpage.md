EVO Nest
Simplify Remote Operations
Reliable, durable, and transportable, EVO Nest is a base for automatic take off, landing, charging, and mission planning for the EVO series. The Nest is designed for all-weather operation and uses a single-piece protective drum with fewer moving parts to simplify maintenance. The Nest fits in the bed of a standard pickup truck and is light enough for 2 people to carry. Paired with the Autel Intergreted command system for centralized drone management, the Nest is easy to set up, maintain, and operate.

Complete Remote
Operations System
The EVO Nest is a complete remote operations system for aircrafts with all-day weather monitoring and rapid deployment. The Autel Remote Operations System consists of the EVO Nest, UAV, and the Autel Integrated Command System to provide a end-to-end solution for remote task management.


Intelligent operations
Multiple Nests can be networked to cover large areas and allow flexible, expandable operations.

Encryption
The EVO Nest supports AES 256 image transmission encryption.


Autonomous Operation
The EVO Nest can be easily deployed in the patrol area for automatic take-off, accurate landing, storage, and automatic charging.

Autonomous, Semi-Autonomous,
Or Remote Piloting
The EVO Nest can issue missions via wired, 4G, or 5G networks, supporting the setting of flight routes, waypoints, angles, targets, time, and frequency through the Autel Integrated Command System (AICS). This enables the aircraft to achieve AI target recognition (people, vehicles, ships, smoke, fire, etc.) and remote image transmission, reducing geographical limitations.



Transportable & Easy Setup
The Nest weighs 154 lbs , has a footprint of less than 1 yd², and can be set up by a team of 2.


All Weather Performance
The Nest's integrated weather systems provide localized weather data for safe remote drone operations. An industrial temperature control unit allows the Nest to work in temperatures between -22℉ and 131℉.

Fast Charge Capable
The EVO Nest is equipped with ultra-fast charging technology, allowing the aircraft's intelligent battery to charge from 10% to 90% in just 25 minutes* at 77°F, optimizing the operational experience.

*The battery temperature must be between 77°F, and 86°F.

Information Management
The EVO Nest uploads flight and mission data into cloud for easy access, storage, and management.

By entering your e-mail address you accept the terms and conditions.
* Before conducting flight operations, users must familiarize themselves with and comply with relevant local laws and regulations. Ensure the aircraft has obtained the necessary certifications and legal airspace permissions.

* The parameters and specifications listed on this page are based on results measured under controlled testing conditions using the EVO Nest. Please note that results may vary under different external environmental conditions, usage methods, and firmware versions. Therefore, actual user experience should take precedence.

* Regarding flight time, the data is obtained under conditions with no wind or other flight interferences, with the aircraft's obstacle avoidance behavior set to braking mode, and the camera performing photo capture only. The aircraft flies continuously at 8 m/s at sea level until the battery reaches 0% capacity. This data is for reference only. To ensure flight safety, users should closely monitor the App's notifications during actual flight operations.

* According to relevant laws and regulations, countries such as China and South Korea only permit the use of downward-facing 24G radar (i.e., millimeter-wave radar installed on the underside of the aircraft for downward detection). For specific usage requirements, please refer to the laws and regulations of the respective country.

* Refers to the maximum wind speed the UAV can withstand in fixed-wing mode.

* If you need more information,please contact our sales team.
